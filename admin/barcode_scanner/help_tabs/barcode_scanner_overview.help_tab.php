<p><strong>Scanning Barcodes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the dropdown and locate your event and click on it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Decide if you want to continuously scan attendees/registrants or lookup an attendee and manually check them in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you’ve selected your event from the dropdown, use your mouse (or finger if using a mobile device) to select the field labeled “Scan or enter barcode here”, which listens for and reads the scanned barcodes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Scan a ticket! This is the fun part. Make sure your handheld scanner is plugged-in to your computer (or connected via bluetooth to your mobile device), then grab a ticket you’ve printed and scan it. If everything works correctly, the scanner should read the barcode and populate the text field with a number/text string that will automatically check-in or display an attendees information.</p>
